This project uses the following tech stack:

1. Threejs
2. React
3. Nextjs
4. Typescript
5. react-three
6. Tailwind css

It has the following functionality:

1. Suspense rendering for 3d objects
2. Dynamic loading for expensive components
3. Responsive and mobile friendly design even for 3d models, though this project has not been made for mobile screens and I recommend you use laptop for optimal experience
4. Stone paper scissor against a computer (since this is a frontend only project I didnt implement multiplayer functionality)
5. Spanish music from the amazing movie 'Chef' which I watched recently

For Navigation. project structure:
Checkout Game.tsx in src for a starting point

I had no experience with threejs before, though I have used A frame. Had a good time building it
